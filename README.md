<h1>RAD150 vs YK11 – What Gave Me Better Muscle Gains</h1>

<p>RAD150 and YK11 are two of the strongest SARMs I’ve ever used. If you’re looking to <strong>bulk fast</strong> or break through a <strong>plateau</strong>, these are serious contenders. But they work differently—and they hit differently too.</p>

<p>I tested both compounds solo, tracked progress with bloodwork, and focused on <strong>lean mass, strength, suppression, and side effects</strong>. Below is a straight-to-the-point comparison based on what I saw, felt, and measured.</p>

<h2>RAD150 – The Long-Acting RAD-140 Beast</h2>

<p><strong>RAD150</strong> (also called TLB-150) is an <strong>esterified version of RAD-140</strong>. The ester makes it more stable and slower-releasing. That means it stays in your system longer and hits harder over time.</p>

<p>I ran RAD150 at <strong>30mg/day for 6 weeks</strong> during a high-protein bulk. It took about 10 days to kick in, but when it did, it was solid.</p>

<h3>My RAD150 Results:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fuller muscles and strength gains by Week 2–3</li>
  <li>Better pumps than regular RAD-140</li>
  <li>Zero water retention</li>
  <li>Appetite went up noticeably</li>
  <li>Some suppression after Week 5</li>
</ul>

<p>The best part? No liver toxicity or estrogen issues. It felt clean, powerful, and stable. If RAD-140 was already your favorite, this is like RAD on steroids—literally.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Longer half-life = smoother gains</li>
  <li>No bloat or gyno signs</li>
  <li>Crazy pumps and vascularity</li>
  <li>Good for clean bulks or strength cycles</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Can be suppressive at higher doses</li>
  <li>Takes longer to “feel” compared to YK11</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Bulking, Strength, Clean Mass</p>

<h2>YK11 – Myostatin Inhibitor That Goes Hard</h2>

<p><strong>YK11</strong> is in its own category. It’s not a “real” SARM—it’s a <strong>synthetic steroid that binds to androgen receptors</strong> and limits myostatin. That’s the protein that tells your body to stop building muscle. Block it, and muscle growth can go wild.</p>

<p>I’ve run YK11 twice now. The last cycle was <strong>10mg/day for 5 weeks</strong>. Short, strong, and effective.</p>

<h3>My YK11 Results:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>More density and hardness than RAD150</li>
  <li>Muscle growth showed FAST—by end of Week 1</li>
  <li>Brutal pumps on every workout</li>
  <li>Appetite stayed normal (a plus for me)</li>
  <li>Suppression kicked in by Week 4</li>
</ul>

<p>YK11 gives more of a “dry and hard” look. It’s insane for <strong>body recomposition or a lean bulk</strong>. But it's more aggressive. You’ll want to run liver support and have a <strong>mini PCT</strong> lined up.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Incredible muscle hardness and vascularity</li>
  <li>Very fast results</li>
  <li>High anabolic activity</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Suppression is more noticeable</li>
  <li>Potential liver strain</li>
  <li>Not beginner-friendly</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Lean Bulking, Strength, Advanced Users</p>

<h2>RAD150 vs YK11 – Head-to-Head Comparison</h2>

<p>Both are high-potency muscle builders, but here’s how they compare side by side based on my results:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Compound</th>
      <th>Muscle Gains</th>
      <th>Strength</th>
      <th>Suppression</th>
      <th>Side Effects</th>
      <th>Kick-In Time</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>RAD150</strong></td>
      <td>8/10</td>
      <td>9/10</td>
      <td>Moderate</td>
      <td>Minimal</td>
      <td>10–14 days</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>YK11</strong></td>
      <td>9/10</td>
      <td>9/10</td>
      <td>Moderate–High</td>
      <td>Some joint and liver strain</td>
      <td>3–5 days</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> If you want a smoother cycle with less risk and more gradual gains, go with RAD150. If you’re okay with more suppression and want faster, harder muscle growth—YK11 wins.</p>

<h2>My Testing Method</h2>

<p>I don’t just guess when it comes to SARMs. Every test I run includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Solo compound cycles (no stacking)</li>
  <li>Consistent training and diet</li>
  <li>Bloodwork before, during, and after cycle</li>
  <li>DEXA scans and visual tracking</li>
</ul>

<p>I also track mood, libido, sleep, and recovery. These aren’t short-term gimmicks—I treat it like a clinical experiment.</p>

<h2>FAQs – RAD150 vs YK11</h2>

<h3>Which is stronger, RAD150 or YK11?</h3>
<p>YK11 hits harder and faster, but comes with more suppression. RAD150 is smoother and more stable over time.</p>

<h3>Do either need PCT?</h3>
<p>Yes. YK11 definitely. RAD150 will likely require a light PCT depending on your dose. Bloodwork is key.</p>

<h3>Can I stack RAD150 and YK11?</h3>
<p>Technically yes, but I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’re experienced and can manage suppression. Both are strong on their own.</p>

<h3>Is RAD150 liver toxic?</h3>
<p>No, RAD150 is not methylated and is considered non-liver toxic in moderate doses.</p>

<h3>Where do you get your SARMs from?</h3>

<h2>Final Verdict</h2>

<p><strong>Go with RAD150</strong> if you want a stable, long-acting anabolic with big strength returns and low risk. It’s ideal for longer bulks and clean mass cycles.</p>

<p><strong>Go with YK11</strong> if you want fast, dense gains and already have some cycle experience. But be ready to manage suppression and support your liver.</p>

<p>Both are legit—just make sure your goals and your tolerance match the compound.</p>
